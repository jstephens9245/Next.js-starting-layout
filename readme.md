# Next.js starting site layout

This repo is for building a site with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).
Please refer to their documentation for specifics. Next handles hot reloading,
server side rendering and bundling for us.

Here is a link to better understand [Learning Next.js](https://learnnextjs.com/) before
you get started.

## General Architecture
- Shared components live in the `components` directory
- Pages, or "routes", live in the `pages` directory

- Styles live in the `styles` directory

## Code Style
Eslint is setup. Please enable eslint in your editor and abide by the rules. Don't hesitate to reach out if a certain rule irks you.
